AsciiIngest tool
----------------

A general ASCII file row based ingestion tool using the DBIngestor library.
This tool allows you to define custom ASCII data formats similar to the 
MS SQL Server format files. However it is possible to define custom checks,
transformation functions, derived data rows, and constant data rows. It is 
easy to extend the assertion and convertion functions, by implementing ones 
own functions in the DBIngestor library. Further the DBIngestor library
provided data buffering for higher ingest performance and many interfaces
to various DB systems.


Please consult doc/userguide.pdf for instrucitons on how to use
this tool or contact the author for further help and instructions:
